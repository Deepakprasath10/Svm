## Spam Mail Classifier Web App

A Flask-based web application that uses a trained Machine Learning model to identify whether a given email/message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

---

## Features

-  Classifies input text as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
-  Uses a trained **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model
-  Preprocessing includes cleaning, stemming, and vectorization
-  Interactive web interface built with HTML, CSS (modern design)
-  Responsive UI with hover effects and mobile support

##  How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Loads a CSV dataset of labeled spam and ham messages.
2. **Preprocessing**: Removes punctuation, stopwords, and applies stemming.
3. **Vectorization**: Converts text into numeric features using CountVectorizer.
4. **Model Training**: Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
5. **Web App**: User enters a message â†’ Model predicts if it's spam â†’ Displays result.
